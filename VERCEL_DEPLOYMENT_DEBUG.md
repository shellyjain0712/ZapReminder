# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FORCE
This file is created to force Vercel to deploy from the correct commit.

## Issue
Vercel consistently deploys from commit c9e31cc instead of the latest commits that contain the TypeScript fixes.

## Latest Commit with Fixes
c4a981a - Contains all necessary TypeScript interface fixes

## TypeScript Interface
The Reminder interface in src/components/Reminders.tsx includes:
```typescript
interface Reminder {
  // ... other properties
  notificationTime?: Date; // When to send advance notification email
  // ... other properties
}
```

## Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes locally
- ✅ ESLint passes locally  
- ✅ Next.js build successful locally
- ❌ Vercel deployment failing due to wrong commit

## Version
0.1.5
